            <h2>What is Social Engineering</h2>
            <p>Social engineering is an attack through human interaction used to gain important information. An attack happens after preparations coming from the attacker. The attacker will gather background information to learn the weaknesses of who is under attack. The attacker may impersonate themselves as a trusted source to lower suspicion of an attack. The attacker could better conceal their identity with information on who they are attacking. A social engineering attack can come in many different forms and it is important that people remain informed on how to prevent these attacks.</p>
